1 - Class FDependencyList
	+ computeKeys(self)
2 - Class Relation:
	- name
	- attributes
	- domain
	- keys
	- fds
	- inclusion dep
	- minimalcover
	- user_FD : a  FDependencyList object with the user defined FDs
	- NF : the NF in which the relation is (fds + user_FDs)
	- NF2_FDs : FDs which have to be keep in order to obtain this form (fds + user_fds - fds that violate the form)
	- NF3_FDs : FDs which have to be keep in order to obtain this form (fds + user_fds - fds that violate the form)
	- BCNF_FDs : FDs which have to be keep in order to obtain this form (fds + user_fds - fds that violate the form)
	- Calls to the methods in NFComputation and SQLParser
2.1 - Class NFComputation
	+ testFD()
	+ checkNF2(): checks if the relation is in NF2
	+ checkNF3(): checks if the relation is in NF3
	+ checkBCNF(): checks if the relation is in BCNF
	+ checkNormalForm(): wrapper
2.2 - Class SQLParser
	+ readSchema: function that connects and reads the schema of a DB and returns a list of Relation objects
	+ createSQL : SQL table creation statement

3 - UI
