2 - Class Relation:
	- name
	- attributes
	- domain
	- keys
	- fds
	- inclusion dep
	- minimalcover
	- NF : the NF in which the relation is
	- user_FD : a  FDependencyList object with the user defined FDs
	- NF2_FDs : FDs which have to be keep in order to obtain this form (fds + user_fds - fds that violate the form)
	- NF3_FDs : FDs which have to be keep in order to obtain this form (fds + user_fds - fds that violate the form)
	- BCNF_FDs : FDs which have to be keep in order to obtain this form (fds + user_fds - fds that violate the form)
	+ testFD(self, FD)
	+ checkNF2(self): checks if the relation is in NF2
	+ checkNF3(self): checks if the relation is in NF3
	+ checkBCNF(self): checks if the relation is in BCNF
	+ checkNormalForm(self): wrapper
